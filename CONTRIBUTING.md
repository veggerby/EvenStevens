# Contributing to EvenStevens™

First, thank you for considering a contribution to the world’s most overengineered parity detection system. We take our parody-level seriousness very seriously.

## How to Contribute

- **No modulo allowed:** All PRs are checked for `%` usage. If you sneak one in, our linter will find you.
- **Microservices only:** If you can solve it with a function, you should probably build a new service instead.
- **Tests are mandatory:** Every PR must include tests, at least one sarcastic assertion, and a Kafka round-trip.
- **Documentation:** If you add a feature, document it in `README.md` and, if sufficiently absurd, in `docs/architecture.md`.
- **CI/CD:** All checks must pass. If you break the build, you must write a haiku about distributed systems in your PR description.

## Code of Conduct

Be excellent to each other. And don’t use modulo.

## Getting Help

Open an issue, start a discussion, or ask GPT-4 if you’re truly lost.
