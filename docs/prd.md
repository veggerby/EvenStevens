# 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Project Title:

**EvenStevens™: Scalable, AI-Powered Evenness Detection System**

### Authors:

You, and a loosely coordinated fleet of serverless lambdas running GPT-4

### Stakeholders:

* Developers who are too emotionally invested in number parity
* Architects who long for the glory of ES/CQRS
* DevOps engineers who enjoy watching logs from 12 services for a `% 2` operation
* The OpenAI API billing department

---

## ✨ Overview

EvenStevens™ is an AI-powered, distributed, event-driven microservice architecture designed to answer one of humanity’s simplest questions:
**“Is this number even?”**

However, instead of a modulo operation, this solution leverages:

* **CQRS** and **Event Sourcing**
* **OpenAI’s GPT API** for determining evenness using natural language
* **Kafka**, **Redis**, **MongoDB**, **Postgres**, and **gRPC**
* **React**, **GraphQL**, **Docker/Kubernetes**, and **Go/Python/Node**
* **Blockchain-based audit logs** (because trustless is trust-more™)

## 🧩 Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement                                                      |
| -- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| F1 | User can submit a number via GraphQL                             |
| F2 | System routes the number as a `DetermineParityCommand` via Kafka |
| F3 | GPT-4 evaluates the number for evenness in plain English         |
| F4 | The system stores all requests/responses as domain events        |
| F5 | Users can query the parity result via GraphQL or gRPC            |
| F6 | Admins can view a dashboard of all parity requests               |
| F7 | System supports retries, circuit breakers, and logging           |
| F8 | System emits a celebratory event for palindromic even numbers    |

## 🚫 Non-Functional Requirements

| ID   | Requirement                                                                 |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NFR1 | System must be hilariously overengineered                                   |
| NFR2 | GPT responses must be parsed using regex and sarcasm                        |
| NFR3 | Responses must be logged to IPFS and optionally to blockchain               |
| NFR4 | No part of the system is allowed to use `% 2` (will be caught in CI linter) |

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

* P99 parity determination latency ≤ 30s
* System costs > \$100/month to run, minimum
* 100% uptime SLA for even-numbered days
* At least one burnout during deployment

---

## 🧠 User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to know if a number is even without doing math.
2. **As an engineer**, I want to deploy 8 microservices instead of using `%`.
3. **As an AI**, I want to feel useful even when being used for parity checks.
4. **As a blockchain evangelist**, I want the result written immutably in a smart contract.
5. **As a compliance auditor**, I want a JSON proof of parity with 3 signatures and a QR code.

# 🏗️ Architecture Document

---

## 🔧 Architectural Style

* Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
* Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
* Event Sourcing (Kafka/EventStore)
* Microservices
* AI-Augmented Computation (OpenAI GPT)
* Event-Driven Architecture
* GraphQL + gRPC dual API
* Multi-cloud and multiverse ready

---

## 🧱 System Components

### 🖥️ Client Layer

* **React Frontend**: UI to input numbers and view history
* **GraphQL Gateway**: API mutations and queries
* **Authentication**: Auth0

---

### 🧾 Command Side (Write Model)

| Component                          | Responsibility                         |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Command Gateway                    | Accepts `EvaluateParityCommand`        |
| Kafka Topic: `commands.parity`     | Streams commands for async processing  |
| Event Store (Mongo + Kafka)        | Persists all command/result events     |
| Parity Evaluation Service (Python) | Sends number to GPT-4, parses response |
| Event Publisher                    | Emits `ParityDeterminedEvent`          |

---

### 📖 Query Side (Read Model)

| Component           | Responsibility                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Event Consumer (Go) | Listens for `ParityDeterminedEvent`  |
| Projection Updater  | Updates Redis/Postgres view          |
| Query API (gRPC)    | Exposes `/getParityResult?number=42` |

---

### 🧠 AI Evaluation Engine

* **GPT-4 Integration**: Constructs conversational prompt:

  ```
  Q: Is 42 even?
  A: Yes, 42 is an even number.
  ```
* **Response Parser**: Uses NLP to detect "even", sarcasm, or poetic allusion
* **Fallback**: If GPT fails, route to HuggingFace model trained on parity poetry

---

### 🛡️ Security & Compliance

* OAuth2 JWT for all APIs
* Logs signed and timestamped
* SHA256-hashed request fingerprint
* Blockchain audit trail (optional)
